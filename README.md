## About

In this project we attempt to predict NFL game winners using classification algorithems, Random Forest and Logistic Regression, in order to test the hypothesis that ELO ratings can be used to predict the outcome as presented by the website FiveThirtyEight.com in their 'NFL Prediction Game'.

The website [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivfethirtyeight.com/) launched a [“prediction game”](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-play-our-nfl-predictions-game/) for NFL games this year, in which the readers assign a probability to to each teams wining chances for every game, competing with fivethirtyeight’s ELO based prediction system.

ELO ranking is a relative ranking system in which performing better then what the ELO would predict leads to an increase in ranking and performing worse that would be expected leads to  decrees. Where predictions and expectations are based on the difference between two players/teams ELO ratings.
A more general explanation can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsYfbmp0To0) by Singingbanana on youtube.

In order to test whether or not ELO is a valid method by which to predict NFL game outcomes, we will attempt to use historic ELO ratings to predict the winners of the 2019-2020 season games which has recently ended.
Using this data we train two machine learning classification algorithems: logistic regression and random forest to test the validity of ELO ratings as a predictor.

The data for this project will be the same data fivethirtyeigh uses to generate their own predictions which can be found in [this](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nfl-elo) github repo.
